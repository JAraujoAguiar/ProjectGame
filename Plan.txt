Plan

1. Locked room puzzle
    - To win the player must open the door before the time runs out
        - The door has a single word conbination lock. 
        - To win the player must guess the correct word and open the door
    - Mayan Tomb themed

2. The Clock
    - The player would have a limited time to finish the puzzle
    - Time will only pass after the player completes an action
    - Once the time runs out, the player will be unable to escape giving them a game over

3. Actions
    - In the room there would be several items that the player can collect and use on the enviroment and other objects
    - Each action will take a specified amount of time consuming time from "The Clock"
    1. The Dictionary
        - In here the player can enter different "Mayan" words and the Dictionary
        - The words within the dictionary will correspond to different Mayan zodiac symbols
        - e.g. "Topolatec" = "Moon" 
    2. The Rock (Dwane Johnson)
        - This is an item the player needs and it's found by "Look"ing around the room 
        - It needs to be used to break other items and reveal their contents
        - It will serve to un-do combinations or break items
        - "Broken" items can no longer be used
    3. The Door
        - The player will have to rotate the wheel to select the correct zodiac symbols
        - It takes 5 minutes to see if the answer is correct.
            - "You hear a rumble, some hidden mechanism seems to be doing... something"
            - "The rumbling stops and after a few minutes nothing has happened. You are not confident you had the right answer."
    4. The Table
        - in the locked room there is a table that the player can use to combine items to get a result
        - correct item combinations will lead into a solution letter or a new item

4. Inventory
    - class with the purpose of holding the players inventory information

5. UI and UX
    - Using a clasic style for a txt adv, but more modern looking
    - Ascii to add images
    - Web or App?
        - Ideally a website that has everything within it
        - Low priority but choice must be made (by sep 25?)
